New Scroll Types Added:
- Psionic Scroll: Damages all visible monsters (existing).
- Teleportation Scroll: Randomly relocates you to a safe, walkable tile on the current level.
- Mapping Scroll: Reveals all non-wall tiles on the current dungeon level.
- Fireball Scroll: Explodes around you, damaging all monsters within a radius (even if not currently visible).
- Regeneration Scroll: Grants a buff that periodically heals body parts over time.

Low-Level Weapons Added:
- Stick: Very weak, very common starter fallback.
- Rusty Knife: Slightly better than a stick; quick.
- Club: Heavier, slower hit; modest damage.
- Bone Shard: Light improvised shiv; fast.

Low-Level Armor Added:
- Tattered Cloak (torso): Minimal protection, very light.
- Padded Cap (head): Small early-game head defense.
- Patchwork Trousers (legs): Light leg covering.
- Worn Sandals (feet): Token foot protection.
- Ragged Gloves (hands): Slight mitigation for hand hits.
- Frayed Bracers (arms): Minimal arm padding.

Usage:
Press 'r' or use the Inventory sidebar (Cast button) to activate the first scroll stack in your inventory.

Gameplay Notes:
- Teleport may land you in unexplored territory—use it to escape danger.
- Mapping does not reveal walls you haven’t seen, but it uncovers all traversable spaces, doors, and stairs.
- Fireball affects monsters within its radius regardless of line of sight (intentionally powerful panic button).
- Regeneration stacks if multiple scrolls are read; each adds its own scheduled healing pulses.
- Early drops now more frequently include improvised gear before true weapons/armor appear.

Enjoy exploring with the expanded magic arsenal and broader early-game loot curve!
